Commercial use is not explicitly prohibited, but many commercial enterprises may be unwilling
to comply with the terms of the RPNX Permissive License v4 due to applicable patent sharing clauses.

For corporations that wish to use the software without the applicable patent sharing provisions,
the software will be made available for commercial licensing.

Note the current version of the software as of 2025-11-6 is not ready for commercial use, this
notice is mainly intended for future versions.
